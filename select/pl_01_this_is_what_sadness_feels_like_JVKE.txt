Roses red and
Violets lookin' blue like me,
so poetic
So pathetic
To think I ever thought
you'd be sympathetic
I know you don't care at all
Please don't ask how I've been
I ain't heard from you
in months
So don't call me a friend
when you're not
So I'm just gon' put
on a sad song
And sit in my room
with the lights off
And put on a face
that I won't show anyone
Yeah, I'm just gon' put
on a sad song
And cry out my eyes
'til the night's gone
And put on a face
that I won't show anyone
So don't call me a friend
when you're not
So don't call me a friend
when you're not
So don't call me a friend
when you're not
Feelin' depressed, yeah,
I've been dealin' with stress
These demons, they fight me
Cut out the fakes, yeah,
I've been dealin' with snakes
Then they try to bite me
I've been down so bad
with nobody near me
I've been down so sad,
can anyone hear me?
I turned my back
I got stabbed
I'm so sad
(Sad, yeah)
Feelin' depressed, yeah,
I've been dealin' with stress
These demons, they fight me
Cut out the fakes, yeah,
I've been dealin' with snakes
Then they try to bite me
I've been down so bad
with nobody near me
I've been down so sad,
can anyone hear me?
I've been down so sad
